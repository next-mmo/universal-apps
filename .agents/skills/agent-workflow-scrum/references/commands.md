# `/kb:` Command Routing

Treat text after a command as the exact scope. Report the selected mode and do not silently expand it.

| Command | Mode |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/kb:help` | List namespaced commands and explain they are skill conventions. |
| `/kb:setup` | Verify Node/pnpm/Git, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and required checks, and leave optional adapters/providers untouched. |
| `/kb:full-setup` | Run `/kb:setup`, initialize all supported repository-local adapters with `skill.sh init all`, then validate them; keep external providers opt-in. |
| `/kb:status` | Read-only task, PRD, branch, checks, blockers, and changes. |
| `/kb:context` | Generate the smallest useful context pack; pass an explicit verified `--base` when committed outgoing scope matters. |
| `/kb:scope` | Read-only explicit outgoing scope: verify the live PR/stack base, then run `pnpm change:scope --base <ref>`; never guess the base. |
| `/kb:impact` | Prefer Graphify impact context (`--provider graphify --level 1`); fall back to local inspection when unavailable. |
| `/kb:report` | Generate local ignored HTML/JSON workflow snapshot; never publish it. |
| `/kb:todo` | Create/refine a backlog task; no implementation. |
| `/kb:plan` | Define outcome, acceptance, non-goals, risk, baseline, verification, recovery. |
| `/kb:define` | Clarify the change contract; do not broaden scope. |
| `/kb:baseline` | Inspect current state and failures; do not fix findings. |
| `/kb:design` | Propose smallest safe design/data flow/boundaries/rollback. |
| `/kb:start` | Select a task or move an approved todo into one WIP task. |
| `/kb:implement` | Implement the approved active task. |
| `/kb:sync` | Reconcile behavior, evidence, affected PRD, index, and workflow state; product changes require synchronized task metadata. |
| `/kb:verify` | Verify live base, run `pnpm verify:plan --base <ref>`, then run only the selected checks plus any boundary-specific evidence the path plan cannot infer; pass the same base to workflow checks. |
| `/kb:test` | Run relevant automated checks and report exact results; do not reflexively run the full suite when a narrower owning check proves the change. |
| `/kb:accept` | Run user-boundary acceptance without fixing during the round. |
| `/kb:review` | Read-only review against explicit outgoing scope, contract, evidence, security, and docs; verify exact base/head first. |
| `/kb:security` | Read-only security/dependency/secret review. |
| `/kb:suggest` | Create/refine a reusable workflow proposal; never self-approve. |
| `/kb:release` | Prepare rollout/health/rollback inputs; never deploy implicitly. |
| `/kb:handoff` | Report outcome, changed files, evidence, risks, skipped checks, decisions. |
| `/kb:done` | Close only after criteria and evidence pass. |
| `/kb:block` | Record external blocker and dependent unverified criteria. |
| `/kb:commit` | Create a local commit only when requested; include AI attribution. |
| `/kb:push` | External Git write; require exact scoped remote/branch and fresh outgoing-scope evidence. |
| `/kb:rollback` | Recover only with an exact authorized target and rollback path. |

Unknown `/kb:*` commands route to `/kb:help`. `/kb:reset`, `/kb:clean`, `/kb:delete`, `/kb:deploy`, and `/kb:publish` never grant destructive or production permission; route them through rollback/release and human approval.
